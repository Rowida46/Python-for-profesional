## Multiprocessing

Multiprocessing Package is used when a long-running process has to be speeded up or multiple processes have to execute __parallelly__. 

Python provides an easy-to-use interface to embed multiprocessing.


`target` : specifies the function to be called

`join()`: helps in making sure that the rest of the program runs only after the multiprocessing is complete.
